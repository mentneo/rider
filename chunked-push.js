GITHUB PUSH TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
=============================================================

The error "curl 16 Recv failure: No route to host" indicates 
a network connectivity issue when trying to push to GitHub.

Steps to resolve:

1. CHECK YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION
   - Make sure you have a stable internet connection
   - Try connecting to a different network if possible
   - Disable VPN if you're using one

2. USE ALTERNATIVE GIT COMMANDS

   Instead of regular push, try:

   git push -u origin main --verbose
   
   If that fails, try:
   
   git push -u origin main --no-thin

3. REDUCE REPOSITORY SIZE

   Your repository is very large (93.82 MiB). GitHub has
   limitations for large files. Make sure your .gitignore
   is correctly excluding node_modules folder:

   git rm -r --cached node_modules
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove node_modules"
   git push -u origin main

4. TRY GITHUB DESKTOP

   If command-line git keeps failing, GitHub Desktop might
   handle large pushes better.

5. CHECK GITHUB STATUS

   Visit https://www.githubstatus.com/ to check if GitHub
   is experiencing any issues.

6. TEMPORARY FIX: UPLOAD WITHOUT GIT

   As a last resort, you could create a ZIP file of your 
   project (excluding node_modules) and upload it directly 
   to GitHub via the web interface.
